 take-home layout test html/css/js

next steps: 
Rewrite CSS & HTML.  

Create specific declarations such as main section#section-1 .row-2 .col2 .row-1.  Rather than general framework-style classes that can be applied anywhere, like .row or .col or .row-flex etc.

For this exercise, targeted css selectors that identify each part of the layout make for faster styling.  The broader, framework-type style rules might be good for a style system we want to apply across many pages.
